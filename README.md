The purpose of this project was to get practice with CSS grid and work with elements like SVGs. 

Post-mortem:

I enjoyed thinking through this project. It was interesting to try to look at what looked like a pretty simple design and think through all of the different grids one might use in order to organize the content. I started by delineating 3 areas in the main container (an aside, a header and a main). I then used grid-template areas to have them take up the parts of the screen I wanted. I then went on to break each of those areas down into a number of other grids, but I used flex on a few different divs when it felt like that was the easiest way to position things where I wanted them. 

It is not perfect and I could spend days fiddling with the different elements to get them to look exaclty how I want, but there is a lot more to learn out there so I am going to move on from this project. I definitely have a much better understanding of how to work with Grid and how to manipulate and move different elements.
